## Installation

To use this kit, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [JSHint](http://jshint.com/)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

To manually set up the kit, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname && npm install && bower install
```

Run `gulp` and start hacking!

## What's here?

`src/assets/` is where you can keep your front-end scripts, styles, or images. In other words, your Sass files, JS files, fonts, and SVGs would live here.

`src/templates/` contains all of your Twig templates. These pretty much correspond 1 to 1 with the PHP files that respond to the WordPress template hierarchy. At the end of each PHP template, you'll notice a `Timber::render()` function whose first parameter is the Twig file where that data (or `$context`) will be used. Just an FYI.

`src/bin/` and `src/tests/` ... basically don't worry about (or remove) these unless you know what they are and want to.

* `dist`: generated by Gulp, this is a *working copy* of your theme for use in development and testing. Symlink `dist` to your `wp-content/themes` directory for local development and testing (e.g. if your theme is in `~/dev/themes/my-theme` and your local copy of WordPress is installed in `~/dev/localhost/wp` you'll want to run `ln -s ~/dev/themes/my-theme/dist ~/dev/localhost/wp/wp-content/themes/my-theme`).

## A FEW OTHER NOTES

### Images

Images are copied from wherever they are in `src` to the same location under `dist`. They are only optimized when running `gulp build` as this operation is resource-intensive.

### PHP

Like images, PHP (and language) files can go anywhere under `src` and will be copied to `dist` while preserving directory structure.


### Timber

Make sure you have installed the plugin for the [Timber Library](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/) (and Advanced Custom Fields - they [play quite nicely](https://github.com/jarednova/timber/wiki/ACF-Cookbook) together).
